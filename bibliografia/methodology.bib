abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people worldwide, causing mental and mainly motor dysfunctions. The negative impact on the patient’s daily routine has moved the science in search of new techniques that can reduce its negative effects and also identify the disease in individuals. One of the main motor characteristics of PD is the hand tremor faced by patients, which turns out to be a crucial information to be used towards a computer-aided diagnosis. In this context, we make use of handwriting dynamics data acquired from individuals when submitted to some tasks that measure abilities related to writing skills. This work proposes the application of recurrence plots to map the signals onto the image domain, which are further used to feed a Convolutional Neural Network for learning proper information that can help the automatic identification of PD. The proposed approach was assessed in a public dataset under several scenarios that comprise different combinations of deep-based architectures, image resolutions, and training set sizes. Experimental results showed significant accuracy improvement compared to our previous work with an average accuracy of over 87%. Moreover, it was observed an improvement in accuracy concerning the classification of patients (i.e., mean recognition rates above to 90%). The promising results showed the potential of the proposed approach towards the automatic identification of Parkinson’s disease.}

abstract = {This work proposes deep learning (DL) based epileptic seizure detection by generating 2D recurrence plot (RP) images of EEG signals for specific brain rhythms. The DL bypasses hand-crafted feature engineering, but extracts feature automatically from input images has displayed significant performance in various domain classification tasks. However, generating 2D images from 1D EEG signals and its quality assessment for DL pipeline has not been addressed properly, which is very crucial as the performance of the DL highly relies on input quality. Besides, suitable brain rhythm for seizure analysis has not been explored properly. Therefore, in this work, 2D input images have been generated by the RP technique from EEG signals for specific brain rhythms by preserving the nonlinear characteristics of EEG and employed a well-known DL, called convolution neural network (CNN). For, experimental validation, two well recognized EEG databases for seizure analysis from Bonn University and CHB-MIT (PhysioNet) have been considered. Eventually, three major parameters — recurrence threshold, time delay, and embedding dimension for an RP image generation have been evaluated and detailed. The results show that the proposed method can achieve classification accuracy up to 93%, which is significantly higher and the δ rhythm has been found suitable for seizure detection. The entropy of RP has been found as a suitable parameter for image quality assessment along with two global statistical parameters such as skewness of root mean square and standard of RP images. In performance evaluation, the proposed method demonstrates its competency by displaying the best classification accuracy compared to related works.}

ABSTRACT={<p><bold>Background:</bold> Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is widely applied as a routine diagnostic tool by clinicians using fetal heart rate (FHR) signals to prevent fetal hypoxia. However, visual interpretation of the FHR usually leads to significant inter-observer and intra-observer variability, and false positives become the main cause of unnecessary cesarean sections.</p><p><bold>Goal:</bold> The main aim of this study was to ensure a novel, consistent, robust, and effective model for fetal hypoxia detection.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this work, we proposed a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system integrated with an advanced deep learning (DL) algorithm. For a 1-dimensional preprocessed FHR signal, the 2-dimensional image was transformed using recurrence plot (RP), which is considered to greatly capture the non-linear characteristics. The ultimate image dataset was enriched by changing several parameters of the RP and was then used to feed the convolutional neural network (CNN). Compared to conventional machine learning (ML) methods, a CNN can self-learn useful features from the input data and does not perform complex manual feature engineering (i.e., feature extraction and selection).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Finally, according to the optimization experiment, the CNN model obtained the average performance using optimal configuration across 10-fold: accuracy = 98.69%, sensitivity = 99.29%, specificity = 98.10%, and area under the curve = 98.70%.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> To the best of our knowledge, this approached achieved better classification performance in predicting fetal hypoxia using FHR signals compared to the other state-of-the-art works.</p><p><bold>Significance:</bold> In summary, the satisfied result proved the effectiveness of our proposed CAD system for assisting obstetricians making objective and accurate medical decisions based on RP and powerful CNN algorithm.</p>}}

ABSTRACT={<p>Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction and behavioral impairment that occurs in old. Early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease is great significance. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals can be used to detect Alzheimer's disease due to its non-invasive advantage. To solve the problem of insufficient analysis by single-channel EEG signal, we analyze the relationship between multiple channels and build PLV framework. To solve the problem of insufficient representation of 1D signal, a threshold-free recursive plot convolution network was constructed to realize 2D representation. To solve the problem of insufficient EEG signal characterization, a fusion algorithm of clinical features and imaging features was proposed to detect Alzheimer's disease. Experimental results show that the algorithm has good performance and robustness.</p>}}

abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases affect approximately 50 million people worldwide; thus, heart disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system. Despite the high popularity electrocardiography, superior automatic electrocardiography (ECG) signal analysis methods are required. The aim of this research was to design a new deep learning method for effectively classifying arrhythmia by using 2-second segments of 2D recurrence plot images of ECG signals. In the first stage, the noise and ventricular fibrillation (VF) categories were distinguished. In the second stage, the atrial fibrillation (AF), normal, premature AF, and premature VF categories were distinguished. Models were trained and tested using ECG databases publicly available at the website of PhysioNet. The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, Creighton University Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Database, MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database, and MIT-BIH Malignant Ventricular Ectopy Database were used to compare six types of arrhythmia. Testing accuracies of up to 95.3 % ± 1.27 % and 98.41 % ± 0.11 % were achieved for arrhythmia detection in the first and second stage, respectively, after five-fold cross-validation. In conclusion, this study provides clinicians with an advanced methodology for detecting and discriminating between different arrhythmia types.}
