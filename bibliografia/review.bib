abstract = {Physiological signals such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) in the intensive care unit (ICU) are often severely corrupted by noise, artifact and missing data, which lead to large errors in the estimation of the heart rate (HR) and ABP. A robust HR estimation method is described that compensates for these problems. The method is based upon the concept of fusing multiple signal quality indices (SQIs) and HR estimates derived from multiple electrocardiogram (ECG) leads and an invasive ABP waveform recorded from ICU patients. Physiological SQIs were obtained by analyzing the statistical characteristics of each waveform and their relationships to each other. HR estimates from the ECG and ABP are tracked with separate Kalman filters, using a modified update sequence based upon the individual SQIs. Data fusion of each HR estimate was then performed by weighting each estimate by the Kalman filters' SQI-modified innovations. This method was evaluated on over 6000 h of simultaneously acquired ECG and ABP from a 437 patient subset of ICU data by adding real ECG and realistic artificial ABP noise. The method provides an accurate HR estimate even in the presence of high levels of persistent noise and artifact, and during episodes of extreme bradycardia and tachycardia.}

abstract = {A method to describe the general characteristics of an EEG trace in a few quantitative terms is introduced. Its descriptive parameters are entirely based on time, but they can be derived also from the statistical moments of the power spectrum. Thus the method provides a bridge between a physical time domain interpretation and the conventional frequency domain description. Further, the parameters are based on the concept of variance, giving them an additive property so that the measured values pertain also to any basic elements from which a complex curve may be composed by superposition. The proposed method offers a way to on-line measurement of basic signal properties by means of a time-based calculation, requiring less complex equipment compared to conventional frequency analysis. The data-reducing capability of the parameters has been experimentally stated in the recording of “sleep profiles”.
Résumé
L'auteur introduit une méthode de description des caractéristiques générales d'un tracé EEG en un nombre limité de termes quantitatifs. Ses paramètres descriptifs sont entièrement basés sur le temps, mais peuvent être dérivés également des moments statistiques du spectre de puissance. Ainsi, cette méthode fait la jonction entre une interprétation du domaine des séries temporelles physiques et la description du domaine fréquentiel conventionnel. De plus les paramètres sont basés sur le concept de variance, leur donnant une propriété supplémentaire de telle sorte que les valeurs mesurées se rapportent également à chaque élément de base à partir duquel une courbe complexe peut être composée par superposition. La méthode proposée offre un moyen de mesurer “on-line” des propriétés de base du signal au moyen d'un calcul basé sur le temps, nécessitant un équipement moins complexe que l'analyse de fréquence conventionnelle. La capacité de réduction des données des paramètries a été spécifiée expérimentalement dans l'enregistrement des “profils de sommeil”.}

abstract = {Background and Objectives
The presence of noise sources could reduce the diagnostic capability of the ECG signal and result in inappropriate treatment decisions. To mitigate this problem, automated algorithms to detect artefacts and quantify the quality of the recorded signal are needed. In this study we present an automated method for the detection of artefacts and quantification of the signal quality. The suggested methodology extracts descriptive features from the autocorrelation function and feeds these to a RUSBoost classifier. The posterior probability of the clean class is used to create a continuous signal quality assessment index. Firstly, the robustness of the proposed algorithm is investigated and secondly, the novel signal quality assessment index is evaluated.
Methods
Data were used from three different studies: a Sleep study, the PhysioNet 2017 Challenge and a Stress study. Binary labels, clean or contaminated, were available from different annotators with experience in ECG analysis. Two types of realistic ECG noise from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB) were added to the Sleep study to test the quality index. Firstly, the model was trained on the Sleep dataset and subsequently tested on a subset of the other two datasets. Secondly, all recording conditions were taken into account by training the model on a subset derived from the three datasets. Lastly, the posterior probabilities of the model for the different levels of agreement between the annotators were compared.
Results
AUC values between 0.988 and 1.000 were obtained when training the model on the Sleep dataset. These results were further improved when training on the three datasets and thus taking all recording conditions into account. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8131 was observed between the score of the clean class and the level of agreement. Additionally, significant quality decreases per noise level for both types of added noise were observed.
Conclusions
The main novelty of this study is the new approach to ECG signal quality assessment based on the posterior clean class probability of the classifier.}

abstract = {Current wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) recording systems have great potential to revolutionize early diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). They are able to continuously acquire an ECG signal for long weeks and then increase the probability of detecting first brief, intermittent signs of the arrhythmia. However, the recorded signal is often broadly corrupted by noise and artifacts, and accurate assessment of its quality to avoid automated misdiagnosis and false alarms of AF is still an unsolved challenge. In this context, the present work is pioneer in exploring the usefulness of transforming the single-lead ECG signal into two common phase space (PS) representations, such as the Poincaré plot and the first order difference graph, for evaluation of its quality. Several machine and deep learning models fed with features and images derived from these PS portraits reported a better performance than well-known previous methods, even when they were trained and validated on two separate databases. Indeed, in binary classification of high- and low-quality ECG excerpts, the generated PS-based algorithms reported a discriminant power greater than 85%, misclassifying less than 20% of high-quality AF episodes and non-normal rhythms as noisy excerpts. Moreover, because both PS reconstructions do not require any mathematical transformation, these algorithms also spent much less time in classifying each ECG excerpt in validation and testing stages than previous methods. As a consequence, ECG transformation to both PS portraits enables novel, simple, effective, and computational low-cost techniques, based both on machine and deep learning classifiers, for ECG quality assessment.}

abstract = {Healthcare is expected to increasingly shift care out of inpatient settings thanks to wearable monitoring systems. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical technique already integrated into wrist-worn commercial products which presents significant advantages in terms of cost and dimensions. PPG-based devices, despite their ability to detect multiple cardiovascular parameters, are affected by several influencing conditions that depend both on technological or environmental variables, and on intra- and inter-subject variability that influences the whole measurement chain and reliability, hindering an objective characterization of PPG devices. Plus, the lack of standardization for data collection and processing leads to the lack of generalizability and reproducibility of results, preventing the full exploitation of the potential prognostic capacity of this technology. Thus, this review aims not only to summarize the main influencing parameters of PPG technology, which should be addressed when testing the sensor, but also to suggest tentative guidelines for a possible future standardization initiative.}

journal = {Physiological Measurement},
abstract = {In this work, we describe a beat-by-beat method for assessing the clinical utility of pulsatile waveforms, primarily recorded from cardiovascular blood volume or pressure changes, concentrating on the photoplethysmogram (PPG). Physiological blood flow is nonstationary, with pulses changing in height, width and morphology due to changes in heart rate, cardiac output, sensor type and hardware or software pre-processing requirements. Moreover, considerable inter-individual and sensor-location variability exists. Simple template matching methods are therefore inappropriate, and a patient-specific adaptive initialization is therefore required. We introduce dynamic time warping to stretch each beat to match a running template and combine it with several other features related to signal quality, including correlation and the percentage of the beat that appeared to be clipped. The features were then presented to a multi-layer perceptron neural network to learn the relationships between the parameters in the presence of good- and bad-quality pulses. An expert-labeled database of 1055 segments of PPG, each 6 s long, recorded from 104 separate critical care admissions during both normal and verified arrhythmic events, was used to train and test our algorithms. An accuracy of 97.5% on the training set and 95.2% on test set was found. The algorithm could be deployed as a stand-alone signal quality assessment algorithm for vetting the clinical utility of PPG traces or any similar quasi-periodic signal.}

			ABSTRACT = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to measure blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. Information about these changes along time can be used for estimation of various physiological parameters, such as heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, and blood pressure, to name a few. As a result, PPG has become a popular biological modality and is widely used in wearable health devices. However, accurate measurement of various physiological parameters requires good-quality PPG signals. Therefore, various signal quality indexes (SQIs) for PPG signals have been proposed. These metrics have usually been based on statistical, frequency, and/or template analyses. The modulation spectrogram representation, however, captures the second-order periodicities of a signal and has been shown to provide useful quality cues for electrocardiograms and speech signals. In this work, we propose a new PPG quality metric based on properties of the modulation spectrum. The proposed metric is tested using data collected from subjects while they performed various activity tasks contaminating the PPG signals. Experiments on this multi-wavelength PPG dataset show the combination of proposed and benchmark measures significantly outperforming several benchmark SQIs with improvements of 21.3% BACC (balanced accuracy) for green, 21.6% BACC for red, and 19.0% BACC for infrared wavelengths, respectively, for PPG quality detection tasks. The proposed metrics also generalize for cross-wavelength PPG quality detection tasks.},

			abstract = {Real-time remote health monitoring is dramatically growing, revolutionizing healthcare delivery and outcome in everyday settings. Such remote services enable monitoring individuals anywhere and anytime, allowing diseases early detection and prevention. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive and convenient technique that enables tracking vital signs such as heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, and blood oxygen saturation. PPG is broadly used in various clinical and commercial wearable devices, as it is easy-to-implement and low-cost. However, the technique is highly susceptible to motion artifacts and environmental noises, which distort the collected signals. Therefore, the signal quality needs to be investigated, and unreliable signals should be discarded. In the literature, rule-based and machine learning-based PPG quality assessment methods have been investigated in several studies. However, the rule-based methods are mostly inaccurate in remote health monitoring, where users engage in different physical activities. The supervised machine learning-based methods –including deep learning–are also infeasible for real-time monitoring applications since they are slow and are dependent on a massive pool of annotated data to train the model. In this paper, we introduce a PPG quality assessment method, enabled by an elliptical envelope, which requires low computational resources. The method clusters the PPG signals into two groups as “reliable” and “unreliable.” We also investigate various features extracted from the PPG signals. Five features with the highest scoring values are selected to be fed to the elliptical envelope model. Moreover, we assess the performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and execution time, using data collected in free-living conditions via an Internet-of-Things-based health monitoring system enabled by smart wristbands. The method is evaluated in comparison to a state-of-the-art PPG quality assessment method. We also provide the model implemented in Python for the community to be used in their solutions.}

The method is, however, highly susceptible to motion artifacts, which are inevitable in remote health monitoring. Noise reduces signal quality, leading to inaccurate decision-making. In addition, unreliable data collection and transmission waste a massive amount of energy on battery-powered devices. Studies in the literature have proposed PPG signal quality assessment (SQA) enabled by rule-based and machine learning (ML)-based methods. However, rule-based techniques were designed according to certain specifications, resulting in lower accuracy with unseen noise and artifacts. ML methods have mainly been developed to ensure high accuracy without considering execution time and device’s energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and energy-efficient PPG SQA method enabled by a semi-supervised learning strategy for edge devices. We first extract a wide range of features from PPG and then select the best features in terms of accuracy and latency. Second, we train a one-class support vector machine model to classify PPG signals into “Reliable” and “Unreliable” classes. We evaluate the proposed method in terms of accuracy, execution time, and energy consumption on two embedded devices, in comparison to five state-of-the-art PPG SQA methods. The methods are assessed using a PPG dataset collected via smartwatches from 46 individuals in free-living conditions. The proposed method outperforms the other methods by achieving an accuracy of 0.97 and a false positive rate of 0.01. It also provides the lowest latency and energy consumption compared to other ML-based methods.}

		abstract = {Objective: Photoplethysmography (PPG) monitoring has been implemented in many portable and wearable devices we use daily for health and fitness tracking. Its simplicity and cost-effectiveness has enabled a variety of biomedical applications, such as continuous long-term monitoring of heart arrhythmias, fitness, and sleep tracking, and hydration monitoring. One major issue that can hinder PPG-based applications is movement artifacts, which can lead to false interpretations. In many implementations, noisy PPG signals are discarded. Misinterpreted or discarded PPG signals pose a problem in applications where the goal is to increase the yield of detecting physiological events, such as in the case of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF)—a common episodic heart arrhythmia and a leading risk factor for stroke. In this work, we compared a traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches for PPG quality assessment in the presence of AF, in order to find the most robust method for PPG quality assessment. Approach: The training data set was composed of 78 278 30 s long PPG recordings from 3764 patients using bedside patient monitors. Two different representations of PPG signals were employed—a time-series based (1D) one and an image-based (2D) one. Trained models were tested on an independent set of 2683 30 s PPG signals from 13 stroke patients. Main results: ResNet18 showed a higher performance (0.985 accuracy, 0.979 specificity, and 0.988 sensitivity) than SVM and other deep learning approaches. 2D-based models were generally more accurate than 1D-based models. Significance: 2D representation of PPG signal enhances the accuracy of PPG signal quality assessment.}

		abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) as a non-invasive and low-cost technique plays a significant role in wearable Internet-of-Things based health monitoring systems, enabling continuous health and well-being data collection. As PPG monitoring is relatively simple, non-invasive, and convenient, it is widely used in a variety of wearable devices (e.g., smart bands, smart rings, smartphones) to acquire different vital signs such as heart rate and pulse rate variability. However, the accuracy of such vital signs highly depends on the quality of the signal and the presence of artifacts generated by other resources such as motion. This unreliable performance is unacceptable in health monitoring systems. To tackle this issue, different studies have proposed motion artifacts reduction and signal quality assessment methods. However, they merely focus on improvements in the results and signal quality. Therefore, they are unable to alleviate erroneous decision making due to invalid vital signs extracted from the unreliable PPG signals. In this paper, we propose a novel PPG quality assessment approach for IoT-based health monitoring systems, by which the reliability of the vital signs extracted from PPG quality is determined. Therefore, unreliable data can be discarded to prevent inaccurate decision making and false alarms. Exploiting a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) approach, a hypothesis function is created by comparing heart rate in the PPG with corresponding heart rate values extracted from ECG signal. We implement a proof-of-concept IoT-based system to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach.}

		abstract = {Remote photoplethysmogram (rPPG) is a low-cost method to extract blood volume pulse (BVP). Some crucial vital signs, such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) etc. can be achieved from BVP for clinical medicine and healthcare application. As compared to the conventional PPG methods, rPPG is more promising because of its non-contacted measurement. However, both BVP detection methods, especially rPPG, are susceptible to motion and illumination artifacts, which lead to inaccurate estimation of vital signs. Signal quality assessment (SQA) is a method to measure the quality of BVP signals and ensure the credibility of estimated physiological parameters. But the existing SQA methods are not suitable for real-time processing. In this paper, we proposedalanzoka an end-to-end BVP signal quality evaluation method based on a long short-term memory network (LSTM-SQA). Two LSTM-SQA models were trained using the BVP signals obtained with PPG and rPPG techniques so that the quality of BVP signals derived from these two methods can be evaluated, respectively. As there is no publicly available rPPG dataset with quality annotations, we designed a training sample generation method with blind source separation, by which two kinds of training datasets respective to PPG and rPPG were built. Each dataset consists of 38400 high and low-quality BVP segments. The achieved models were verified on three public datasets (IIP-HCI dataset, UBFC-Phys dataset, and LGI-PPGI dataset). The experimental results show that the proposed LSTM-SQA models can effectively predict the quality of the BVP signal in real-time.},

		abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical method to acquire various vital signs, including heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). The PPG method is highly susceptible to motion artifacts and environmental noise. Unfortunately, such artifacts are inevitable in ubiquitous health monitoring, as the users are involved in various activities in their daily routines. Such low-quality PPG signals negatively impact the accuracy of the extracted health parameters, leading to inaccurate decision-making. PPG-based health monitoring necessitates a quality assessment approach to determine the signal quality according to the accuracy of the health parameters. Different studies have thus far introduced PPG signal quality assessment methods, exploiting various indicators and machine learning algorithms. These methods differentiate reliable and unreliable signals, considering morphological features of the PPG signal and focusing on the cardiac cycles. Therefore, they can be utilized for HR detection applications. However, they do not apply to HRV, as only having an acceptable shape is insufficient, and other signal factors may also affect the accuracy. In this article, we propose a deep learning–based PPG quality assessment method for HR and various HRV parameters. We employ one customized one-dimensional (1D) and three 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train models for each parameter. Reliability of each of these parameters will be evaluated against the corresponding electrocardiogram signal, using 210 hours of data collected from a home-based health monitoring application. Our results show that the proposed 1D CNN method outperforms the other 2D CNN approaches. Our 1D CNN model obtains the accuracy of 95.63\%, 96.71\%, 91.42\%, 94.01\%, and 94.81\% for the HR, average of normal to normal interbeat (NN) intervals, root mean square of successive NN interval differences, standard deviation of NN intervals, and ratio of absolute power in low frequency to absolute power in high frequency ratios, respectively. Moreover, we compare the performance of our proposed method with state-of-the-art algorithms. We compare our best models for HR-HRV health parameters with six different state-of-the-art PPG signal quality assessment methods. Our results indicate that the proposed method performs better than the other methods. We also provide the open source model implemented in Python for the community to be integrated into their solutions.},

	ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this study was to develop a machine learning model that could accurately evaluate the quality of a photoplethysmogram based on the shape of the photoplethysmogram and the phase relevance in a pulsatile waveform without requiring complicated pre-processing. Photoplethysmograms were recorded for 76 participants (5 min for each participant). All recorded photoplethysmograms were segmented for each beat to obtain a total of 49,561 pulsatile segments. These pulsatile segments were manually labeled as ‘good’ and ‘poor’ classes and converted to a two-dimensional phase space trajectory image using a recurrence plot. The classification model was implemented using a convolutional neural network with a two-layer structure. As a result, the proposed model correctly classified 48,827 segments out of 49,561 segments and misclassified 734 segments, showing a balanced accuracy of 0.975. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of the developed model for the test dataset with a ‘poor’ class classification were 0.964, 0.987, and 0.848, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.994. The convolutional neural network model with recurrence plot as input proposed in this study can be used for signal quality assessment as a generalized model with high accuracy through data expansion. It has an advantage in that it does not require complicated pre-processing or a feature detection process.},
