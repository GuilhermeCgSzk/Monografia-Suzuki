%Figure~\ref{fig:boxplots} depicts presents the boxplot of Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Cohen's Kappa distributions for different \glspl{CV} models tested on the \gls{BUTPPG} database. From these graphs, we can notice that, for the recall score, all projections are very equated. Moreover, it is noticeable that \acrshort{rp} and the proposed \gls{PM} have improved performances when compared with other \gls{mtf} and \gls{gaf} projections, especially when we observe the minimum, maximum, and the first quartiles of distributions, presented in Table~\ref{tab:boxplots}. From this table, we can perceive, at first glance, that the \gls{rp} and the \gls{PM} are generally superior methods if compared with the other two. In fact, \acrshort{rp} and \gls{PM} first quartiles are greater than \acrshort{gaf} and \acrshort{mtf} third quartiles considering all metrics except Recall Score, which shows that 75\% of samples in \acrshort{rp} and \gls{PM} are generally greater than 75\% of samples in \acrshort{gaf} and \acrshort{mtf}. The detailed performance of the points in the distributions considered in Figure~\ref{fig:boxplots} is depicted per model in Table~\ref{tab:results}.

% Each of the 4 populations produced box plots shown in figure \ref{fig:boxplots}, allowing, at first glance, to see the Recurrence Plot and the \gls{PM} as generally superior methods if compared with the other two. In fact, \acrshort{rp} and P\gls{PM} first quartiles are greater than \acrshort{gaf} and \acrshort{mtf} third quartiles considering all metrics except Recall Score, what shows that 75\% of samples in \acrshort{rp} and \gls{PM} are generally greater than 75\% of samples in \acrshort{gaf} and \acrshort{mtf}.    %TODO: falar do Cohen Cappa Score
