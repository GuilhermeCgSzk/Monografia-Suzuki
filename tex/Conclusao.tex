%This work presented a study on \gls{SQA} for \gls{ppg} signals. The investigated approach consists of projecting \gls{1D} signals onto \gls{2D} images using \acrshort{rp}, \acrshort{gaf}, and \acrshort{mtf} methods. Further to these methods, we also proposed the use of a mixture of them. Results indicate that \acrshort{rp} and \gls{PM} projection methods achieved better performance than \acrshort{gaf} and \acrshort{mtf} methods, while \acrshort{rp} and \gls{PM} had similar results. While the set of machine learning models was large, the number of data available in the \gls{BUTPPG} dataset was small and unbalanced, not giving very definitive results. Therefore, the experiment needs to be replicated on a large dataset, either by using data augmentation techniques to balance and enlarge the BUT PPG dataset or by utilizing another dataset with more samples.
