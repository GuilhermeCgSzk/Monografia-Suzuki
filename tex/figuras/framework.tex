	\caption{The framework of the experiment. Red dotted arrows indicates data flow that sources from the  BUTPPG Dataset, while the full black lines, labeled with an verb, represent a relationship ``A do B'', where the arrow starts on A and end on B. Notice that the figure presents the training-testing cycle for only one of the twelve folds. The above schema is replicated for each combination of  Computer Vision Model and Projection Algorithm.}
