	\caption{Samples of the four signals of the subject with id equal to 11 (where the first subject has id 0). The ``Good'' signals color is blue, while the ``Bad'' signals are red. In those graphs, the vertical dimension is the average of all pixels intensity in a frame, while the horizontal dimension is the time instant in frames. Notice that, since those records are 10 seconds long, it's implied that the sampling frequency is 30 Hz.}
