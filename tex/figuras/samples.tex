	\caption{Samples of the four signals of the same subject with id equal to 11 from the \gls{BUTPPG} dataset. The ``Good'' signals are in blue, while the ``Bad'' signals are in red. In those graphs, the vertical dimension is the average of all pixels intensity in a frame, while the horizontal dimension is the time instant in frames. These records are 10 seconds long and sampled at 30 Hz.}
