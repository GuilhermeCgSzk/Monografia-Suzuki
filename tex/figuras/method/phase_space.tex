    \caption[Time delay phase spaces.]{On the left, we have the signal of the figure \ref{fig:methodology:signal} on the time delay phase space, without temporal information. Its parameters are dimension $d=2$ and delay $\tau=\RPDelay$. On the right, we have almost the same figure, but with the recurrences represented by red lines $\vec{s_i} - \vec{s_j}$ that links the pair of near points that have a distance bellow $\varepsilon=\RPThreshold$. That figure omits the recurrences to the point itself.}
